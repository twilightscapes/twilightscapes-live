Finding obscure locations and unusual subject matter, Todd has excelled at capturing long exposure photos of rarely seen moments of time.

As a location scout and avid urban explorer, Todd learned to photograph what he sees and to bring the unique subject matter he finds to light. 

> Finding yourself at 3am in a graveyard filming flowers; some may see that as weird, but for me, it's pure tranquility.

Let Todd's night photography and digital storytelling, prove to you that the night is indeed beautiful.
