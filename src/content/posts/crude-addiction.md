Watching shadows can be a fun pastime on a full-moon night such as this. As the moon reached it's peak int he sky, I noticed the shadows were making for a great foreground element other than ther car. 

Upon shooting over the course of a couple of hours I returned with a bunch of cool images. But while editing, I noticed that the shadows moved during the course of my shooting time, and when viewing the series quickly, the shadows looked like hands reaching out towards the car. 

So, it seemed appropriate to take it to the next level and add some animation to illustrate better what I saw from that night. 

I hope you like it.
