Have you ever wanted to ride an asteroid through space? Ever wondered what it would be like to have your personal rock to ride through the Cosmos? 

Well, present your E-Ticket (most of you were born centuries after we first colonized asteroids and won't remember what an E-Ticket is, but play along) to get an exclusive trip to the outer systems and get the ride of your lifetime on a small rock plummeting through the dark and mysterious Universe. 

This is the first of a new series called ASTEROID! where Twilightscapes takes you on a miraculous trek trough the eons of Space. 

Check your propulsion restraints and monitor your air supply (or just hold your breath), because this one is going to be a wild ride. In the name of an immortal Space Commander, "Never give up... Never Surrender!"
