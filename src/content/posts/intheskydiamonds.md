### I froze my ass for this shot

This is from New Year's Eve a couple years back when I was camping in Utah. It was VERY cold but because of exposure issues with the stark contrasting brightness vs darkness, I tried to keep my campfire to a bare minimum.

I can safely say that this fire was more of a waving flame, than a heat-producing fire. 

Ah the things I do for my art. LOL!

This is one of my favorite images (because it features me, of course!) and is part of an upcoming series that I call "Camping Man". 

Be sure to let me know your thoughts in the comments below!

Thanks
