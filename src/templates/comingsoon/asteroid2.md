I hear Neptune's moons are spectacular in September when the solar winds drive the dust into the atmosphere. 

But, if you think the Northern Lights are something, wait until you see the glow of a Nebula even though faint. 

Get on board, let's get the rock of dirt started up, so we can check things out!

Be sure to sign the flight manifest below, to make things official. 

Can't wait for you to see this one.
